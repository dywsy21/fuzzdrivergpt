# Vulnerability Propagation Auto Validator

This is the repository for the Vulnerability Propagation Auto Validator project. This project is a tool that can be used to automatically validate the propagation of vulnerabilities in a software system. The tool is designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate the propagation of vulnerabilities in a software system.

This project is based on [fuzzdrivergpt](https://github.com/occia/fuzzdrivergpt), refer to its README for building of fuzzdrivergpt part of this project.

Note that currently we've not fully tailored the project to be portable. Refer to `build_cfgs/` directory for the build configurations of the two propagation examples in the essay.
